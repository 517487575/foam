# Proposal: Block Embeds

Embedding content blocks (sections, or any html blocks with id) so that they are visible in the document where they are being linked from.

We could use [VS Code Peek Definition](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-view-and-edit-code-by-using-peek-definition-alt-plus-f12?view=vs-2019) to do this.

You should be able to embed any wiki link, using the same [[proposal-deep-links]] anchor syntax:
```
page#anchor
```

Our options for syntax:

1. HTML style embed
<embed ref="blank-document#section-3-bis"/>

2. Mediawiki hybrid monster
[[blank-document#section-1]]<embed />

3. Our own special ?embed hack
[[blank-document?embed#section-1]]

In order to get these to render inside HTML pages, we will need to customise the renderer. [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx)

Before properly implementing embedding with custom sections we need to solve some of the issues described in [[proposal-deep-links]]

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[proposal-deep-links]: proposal-deep-links "Proposal: Deep links"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
