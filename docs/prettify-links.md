# How to easily prettify links

We all like to add links to our notes.
But a lot of the time, plain URLs aren't very readable and it's tedious to add a nice title.
This recipe explains how to automate this.

## Required Extensions

Markdown Link Expander will scrape your URL's `<title>` tag to create a nice Markdown-style link.

## Instructions
